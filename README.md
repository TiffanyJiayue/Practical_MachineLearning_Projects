# Machine Learning


What I learn from Machine Learning Courses:

Learn, understand, and differentiate / the human learning process

Machine Learning algorithms (libraries: Scikit Learn/Pandas/Numpy)
1. Regression: simple linear regression/multiple linear regression/ regression trees
2. Classification: Logistic regression/ KNN (K-nearest neighbors)/ SVM (Support vector machines)/ Multiclass prediction/ Decision trees
3. Clustering: K-means

Some real-world examples: 
1. In the healthcare industry, data scientists use Machine Learning to predict whether a human cell believed to be at risk of developing cancer is benign or malignant.
2. Decision trees help in learning from historical data, allowing doctors to prescribe the proper medicine for patients.
3. Whether to approve loan applications/bank customer segmentation.
4. Help streaming platforms develop recommendations about various products (movies) and services.
5. Given an automobile data set, we can use the scikit-learn library to estimate the CO2 emission of cars using their engine size or cylinders.
